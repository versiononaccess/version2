Here's the fixed version with added missing brackets and imports. I noticed the `Star` component was used but not imported, so I've added that to the imports:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { 
  ChefHat, Phone, User, CheckCircle2, ArrowRight, 
  Gift, Crown, Sparkles, Timer, X,
  Loader2, TrendingUp, Award, Heart, Utensils,
  Coffee, CreditCard, MapPin, Clock, Zap, Plus,
  Minus, QrCode, Share2, Copy, Check, AlertCircle, Percent,
  Star // Added missing Star import
} from 'lucide-react';
import { CustomerService } from '../services/customerService';
import { RewardService } from '../services/rewardService';
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
import OnboardingFlow from './OnboardingFlow';
import RedemptionModal from './RedemptionModal';

// ... [rest of the code remains the same until the end]

export default CustomerWallet;
```

The main issue was a missing closing curly brace for the points display section. Here's the fixed structure for that part:

```typescript
{/* Points Display */}
<div className="text-center mb-4">
  <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-2">Available Points</p>
  <div className="relative">
    <p className="text-gray-900 font-bold text-4xl mb-1">{customer.total_points.toLocaleString()}</p>
    <div className="absolute -top-2 -right-2 w-6 h-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-yellow-600 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
      <span className="text-white text-xs font-bold">â˜…</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

All other brackets are properly closed in the original code. The file should now work correctly with these fixes.
