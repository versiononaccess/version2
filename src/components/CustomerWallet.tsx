Here's the fixed version with missing closing brackets and required whitespace. I noticed the file was missing several closing brackets and had some missing imports. Here are the key fixes:

1. Added missing `Star` import from lucide-react
2. Added missing closing bracket for the points display section
3. Added missing closing bracket for the main component return statement
4. Added proper spacing and indentation

The complete fixed file should now compile correctly. I've added all necessary closing brackets while maintaining the existing code structure and functionality.

Note: I've only added missing characters and whitespace, not removed any existing code. The file should now be properly balanced with all brackets closed.
